    ### Project Overview
    In this project, participants were challenged to develop a predictive model to forecast the availability of docked bikes at various bike-sharing stations in Barcelona. Bike sharing is a popular mode of transportation in many urban areas, and accurate predictions of bike availability can help riders plan their commutes and minimize wait times.
    
    Given a dataset with historical information of the stations, they were tasked with developing models that can accurately forecast the availability of docks at different times and locations.
